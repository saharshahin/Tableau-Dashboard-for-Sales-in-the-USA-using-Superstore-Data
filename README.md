This repository contains a Tableau dashboard that visualizes sales data for the USA using the Superstore dataset. 
The Superstore dataset is a publicly available dataset that contains data on sales, profits, and other metrics for a fictional company that sells office supplies.

The dashboard provides an interactive view of the sales data, allowing users to explore the data and gain insights into sales trends and patterns. 
The dashboard includes several visualizations, including:

- Total Sales, Total Profit, Total Units: A summary view that shows the total sales, total profit, and total units sold for the selected state and region.
- Sales by Category: A bar chart that shows sales by category of product for the selected state and region.
- Sales and Profit by State: A map view that shows sales and profit by state for the selected region.
- Sales and Profit Trends: A line chart that shows sales and profit trends over time for the selected state and region.
- Sales by Segment: A pie chart that shows sales by customer segment for the selected state and region.

The dashboard is built using Tableau Public, a free platform for creating and sharing data visualizations. 
The Superstore dataset is included in the repository, along with a Tableau workbook file (.twbx) that contains the dashboard.
